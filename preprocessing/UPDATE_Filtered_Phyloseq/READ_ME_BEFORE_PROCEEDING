## READ ME BEFORE PROCEEDING## 
 - after it was determined that using the code from lecture was insufficient to remove the chloroplast ASVs from our sample, I additionally
removed them at the genus level. Before rarifying I checked that no chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA was left. 
 - New Rarified and regular phyloseq file are good, but please review code before your own analysis. Code will be in this folder.
