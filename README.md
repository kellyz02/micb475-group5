### Discussion 

**Datasets/Topics of Interest** 
- Zoo captivity
  - Does a certain diet type exacerbate the impact of captivity on the animal’s microbiome?
    - The study seems to already cover this main question by investigating diet type/diet breadth on microbiome diversity.  
    - Could we instead specifically compare different animal species?
    - From the paper: future directions alluded to studying reduced fiber uptake in captive animals
  - Look into locations / climate?
  - Maturity of the animals?
  - Question for the TA: If we were to use this dataset, is it best to focus on specific species, rather than all the species sampled?
- Anemia / Infant (potentially combining the two)
  - How do the microbiomes of children who are stunted or wasted compare? 
  - Composition? Richness? Abundance? 
  - Could potentially look at stunting or wasting individually between the two datasets
  - Compare microbiomes from children stunting and wasting from two different locations 
  - Comparative analysis of the impact of anemia vs. infant feeding on stunting? 
  - How does stunting impact the microbiomes of children in general (treating the 2 datasets as 1 big one)?
- Potential datasets that didn’t make the cut: Gastric cancer, Alcohol, & MS
